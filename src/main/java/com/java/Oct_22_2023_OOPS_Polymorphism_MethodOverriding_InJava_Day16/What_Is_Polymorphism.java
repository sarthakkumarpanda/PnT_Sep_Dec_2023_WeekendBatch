	//Poly means many
	//Morphism means forms
	
	//Types of polymorphism in java - 2 types
	
	//1. Compile Time Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism
	
	//How to achieve CompileTimePolymorphism??
	//Ans: By Method Overloading
	
	//How to achieve method overloading?
	//  Method name should be the same
	//  Class should be the same
	//  Parameters/Arguments should be different
	
	
	//2. Run Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism
	
	//How to achieve Run Time Polymorphism?
	//Ans : By Method Overriding
	
	//How to achieve method overriding?
	// Method name should be same
	// Class should be different
	// Arguments will be same
	// Inheritance has to be there (IS-A) 
	//Access modifer of the Child Class methods which have been over-ridden from the parent has to be equal or higher
