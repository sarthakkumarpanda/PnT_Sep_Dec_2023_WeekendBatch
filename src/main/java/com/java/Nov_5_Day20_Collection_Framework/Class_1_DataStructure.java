	//1. Primitive DS
	//2. Non - Primitive DS
	
	
	//Non Primitive Data Structure is further divided into 2 types
	//1. Linear DS - String, Arrays, List, Set, Queue, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, etc..
	//2. Non-Linear DS - Graphs and Trees
	
	//Difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive DS
	
	//Difference 1 - Primitive DS cannot hold multiple data.

		String S1 = "abcdefghijkl";
	    int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
	}
	
	//Difference 2 - Primitive DS can be used to write simple programs such as Calculator, SnakeGame, Currency Converter but non-primitive
	//               DS can be used to write large scale applications such as e-Commerce, Social Networking, Banking, etc.
	
	//Algorithms need very strong data backup
	
	
	//Reason - Collection Framework is part of Non-Primitive DS and it is nothing but a pre-defined API
