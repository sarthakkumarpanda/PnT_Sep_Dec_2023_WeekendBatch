	//OOPs - Object Oriented Programming [System or Structure]
	//It is a programming paradigm [ways of doing programming]
	//Procedural Programming
	//Functional Programming
	//Logical Programming
	//Structured Programming
	
	//OOPs in java has 6 pillars
	
	//1. Class and Objects
	//2. Methods
	//3. Inheritance
	//4. Polymorphism
	//5. Abstraction[Abstract Class and Interface]
	//6. Encapsulation
	
	
	//Let us understand Class
	//If you consider Java, broadly Classes are defined in 2 types:
	//1. Pre-defined Classes
	//2. User-defined Classes
	//https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/allclasses-index.html - List of all Pre-defined classes in java
	
	//What is the problem if a user tries to replicate the same name of the Class which is already pre-defined?
	//Note: Do not create a User-defined class which is equivalent to Pre-defined Class in java. If you do this, then the compiler will get confused
	
	//What is a Class?
	//It is a blueprint or a template which allows you to convey your logic
	//It represents set of properties that are common to all objects of one type
	//Class does not occupy memory because it is not a physical entity. Class is a logical entity
	//Collection of Objects, Methods, Constructors, Variables, Blocks, NestedClass
	
	//What are the access modifiers that can be used for a Class?
	//public and default. You cannot use private and protected to define a Class
	
	
	//Road - road is a Class which gives you a platform to drive your cars
	//Cars
	//Buses
	//Trucks
	//2-wheelers
}

class Define_Objects{ //if the original class is defined as public/default then the nested class can only be defined as default.
