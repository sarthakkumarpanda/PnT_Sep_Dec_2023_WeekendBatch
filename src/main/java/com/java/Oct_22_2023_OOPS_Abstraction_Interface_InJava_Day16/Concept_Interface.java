	//What is an interface?
	
	
	//100% abstraction
	//interface is blueprint of a Class
	//it tells a Class what to do but it does not tell how to do.
	//methods inside the interface are abstract and public
	//variable are final, static and public 
	//from jdk8 default concrete methods were allowed
	//from jdk9 private concrete methods were allowed
	//from jdk8 static concrete methods were allowed
	
	//a concrete(regular/simple/normal) Class which implements the interface is known as the implementing Class of that interface
	//one concrete Class can implement multiple interfaces - this is the only place where multiple inheritance is allowed in java
	//when a concrete Class implements an interface, it also has to implement all the abstract methods of the interface
	//a concrete Class can extend an Abstract Class as well as implement an interface or implement multiple interfaces
